# Bravura Dam Water Level Study

# Intro

One of the key drivers behind our decision to undertake our regenerative project in this particular location was the alarming threat to the water level of Bravura Dam, which is considered one of the most endangered in all of Portugal. Our primary objective is not only to address this issue but also to positively impact the micro-climate of the region.

In order to effectively measure the progress and success of our goals, it was imperative for us to establish a comprehensive baseline. Consequently, one of our initial steps involved conducting a qualitative study to track the evolution of the Bravura dam water level over time.

  

# Qualitative Analysis

Qualitative analysis of a dam water level involves the assessment and interpretation of non-numerical or subjective factors related to the water level in a dam. It focuses on understanding the overall condition and behavior of the water level rather than quantifying it with precise measurements.

  

The following analysis includes observations and descriptions of the water level. Additionally, we considered other contextual factors that can influence the dam water level, such as weather conditions and surrounding vegetation. These factors are important for understanding the overall quality and health of the water in the dam.

  

The goal is to provide valuable insights into the subjective aspects of the dam water level, helping to identify potential issues, risks, or changes that may require further investigation or action.

  

  

## Remote Sensing Data

  

For the study of Bravura Dam water level we compiled public earth observation data from the Landsat (US) + Sentinel (EU) missions. Which have data available since 1974 and are still going on to this day. With this data we then applied the Normalized Difference Water Index filter which is the most suitable for the study water bodies.

Bellow are displayed two animations that were generated using the [EO Browser](https://apps.sentinel-hub.com/eo-browser) corresponding to the periods of 1975-1993 and 1993-2023. These animations combine data from different missions which explains why the resolution is changing throughout time.

After the animations you can find a table that contains the conclusions extracted from a qualitative analysis of the data followed by a brief description of the conclusions we took.

> The normalized difference water index is most appropriate for water body mapping. Values of water bodies are larger than 0.5. Vegetation has smaller values. Built-up features have positive values between zero and 0.2.

### Analysis Conclusions

  

*   The current water level is very low compared with the average but such a low level has been observed before in 1983 and 1995.
*   In both cases there were around 2-3 years where the dam water level was low and then filling up to full capacity in a single rainy season.
*   There seems to be a cycle of around 10 years where the level of the water drops but not always is a level as extreme as the current one.
*   In 2022 and 2023 has been the first time in our records we observed such an extreme low level at Spring time when the Dam is expected to have it's maximum water level of the year.
*   From 1996 to 2018 (22 years) the dam was basically always close to maximum capacity, only experiencing a brief lowering of the water level in 2005.

  

## Weather Data

  

To complement the qualitative data analysis of the dam water level, we have also retrieved precipitation and temperature data. This additional information will provide valuable insights into the factors influencing the water level fluctuations in the dam. By analyzing the precipitation and temperature data alongside the qualitative data, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the patterns and trends in the dam's water level. This holistic approach will enable us to make more informed decisions and predictions regarding the management of the dam and its water resources.

  

### Precipitation

  

Precipitation data is highly valuable for complementing this qualitative analysis. It provides crucial information about the amount and distribution of rainfall in the specific area, which directly affects the dam water level.

  

By analyzing precipitation data, we hope to establish a clear relationship between rainfall and dam water level. When there is significant rainfall in the catchment area of a dam, it leads to an increase in the inflow of water into the reservoir. This influx of water raises the dam water level.

  

Conversely, during periods of low or no rainfall, the inflow of water into the dam decreases, resulting in a decline in the dam water level. Precipitation data helps us understand these fluctuations and identify patterns and correlations in the relationship between rainfall and dam water level.

  

To conduct this study we used the [public data set](https://www.ipma.pt/resources.www/clientes/10300.dataset.pt02/pt02_netcdf.zip) provided by IPMA, Instituto Português do Mar e da Atmosfera that contains the daily precipitation in Portugal with 0.2° of horizontal resolution for the period of 1950-2003.
